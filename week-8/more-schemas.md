What is a one-to-one database?

A one-to-one database is a database that relates to one ID in another database.

When would you use a one-to-one database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

One-to-one databases are used when there are one-way relationships (all bananas are fruits, not all fruits are bananas.)

What is a many-to-many database?

A many-to-many database is a database that connects two different databases by linking their IDs.

When would you use a many-to-many database? (Think generally, not in terms of the example you created).

Many-to-many databases are used when there are two different complex databases that need to be linked in some way, shape, or form.
