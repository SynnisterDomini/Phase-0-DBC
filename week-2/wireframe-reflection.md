What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a template that is used to outline the intended design of a website.

What are the benefits of wireframing?

Wireframing allows people to have a visual representation of the end product they wish to create with their code. 

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I chose to go with a simplistic and direct wireframe for my website, so I found it to be rather enjoyable. 

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I revised my wireframe several times because I kept coming up with different ideas.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

During this challenge I mainly asked myself what common parts of websites to people expect. I looked at the website designs of facebook, linkedin, and google plus for inspiration. I also tried to figure out how I would use a relative link to link to another repository, I'm still not sure about that.


Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I enjoyed making the wireframe, I thought it was very tedious to try to link the images, though.
