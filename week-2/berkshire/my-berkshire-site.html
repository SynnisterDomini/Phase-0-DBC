What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Honestly, it was a varied experience. I thought that adding links was quite straightforward, but when I was going to  list all the different links for "A message from Warren E Buffett", etc. I was about to make a bunch of different paragraph tags until my partner informed me that it would be more efficient to use an unordered list.

 How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Honestly we didn't really need html5 elements, we just used general html.

 How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I think we did fine, everything looks a little bland, but that just means we'll have to get good at using css in week 3.

 What seems good and bad about HTML?

 HTML seems like it could be a little tedious to code in, given that what we can achieve in a text editor with a simple hit of the "enter" key, HTML accomplishes with <p> </p> which can get really annoying if you have to put multiple paragraphs into a website. However, HTML code is extremely easy to translate what you see in code to what you expect to see in a website, so changes can be easily done to match a client's needs.

 What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

 As of right now, unfortunately, I don't really have any tricks. I have a few commands that I remember because I used them a lot, but I ended up googling what tags I didn't remember.
