What does puts do?

Puts is like a print command, but it does not return your variable (it returns nil instead), and it also automatically starts a new line after printing the requested information.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers, floats potentially have decimal places.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will only provide integers (rounded down) for their results, whereas float division will include decimal places. This is important because integer division would state that 5/2 = 2, whereas float division would say that 5/2 = 2.5
