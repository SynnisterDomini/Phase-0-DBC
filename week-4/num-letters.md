What does puts do?

Puts is like a print command, but it does not return your variable (it returns nil instead), and it also automatically starts a new line after printing the requested information.

What is an integer? What is a float?

Integers are whole numbers, floats potentially have decimal places.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Integer division will only provide integers (rounded down) for their results, whereas float division will include decimal places. This is important because integer division would state that 5/2 = 2, whereas float division would say that 5/2 = 2.5

ruby code: Hours in a year

def calculate_hours
	p 365*24
end
calculate_hours

ruby code: Minutes in a decade

def caclculate_min
	p 10*365*24*60
end
caclculate_min

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby calculates from left to right.

What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers, floats have decimals.

What is the difference between integer and float division?

Integer division takes the answer and rounds down to make it an integer. Float division keeps the decimal.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are data points using words. They're useful when communicating with humans because they store information in a way that we are used to looking them up.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables specifically defined in a method. We use them so that we don't accidently mess with our code in case we have another variable with the same name.

How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

The challenge wasn't bad, I consider it a good review.
