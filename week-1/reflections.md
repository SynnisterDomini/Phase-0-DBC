#1.1 Think about Time

This section taught me about making the most of my time, and most importantly, taking time to relax in order to get the most out of your time overall. I appreciated how the section itself encouraged time management by saying "It's easy to get lost in research, so limit yourself to an hour or research".

The portion of this section that spoke to me the most was the portion on Time Boxing, especially since rather than focusing on finishing the project, time boxing focuses on stopping your work once the time is over. This is very crucial for working individuals to understand. I know many individuals who will finish their work on their own time, and although that is great for their company, I feel that doing so is detrimental to their current health.

Currently I manage my time by focusing on specific goals and having rewards tied to those goals, usually in the form of 5 to 10 minute breaks. I believe that this current strategy keeps me focused and efficient with my work.

I currently employ time boxing and encourage that my co-workers do the same. I make sure that they do not talk to me about work outside of the workplace, and have us all focus on having our own private lives.

In regards to phase 0, I plan to do most of my work in chunks in the mornings, before I go to my day job, while making up work as necessary during the weekend.

#1.2 The Command Line

A shell is a user interface that allows the user to navigate and access their computer. a bash is a type of shell that allows users to navigate the computer using a command line.

The most challenging thing for me at the moment is remembering all the commands and how they interact with each other. In particularly, I have trouble spelling things correctly and typing too quickly when I'm looking to change directories or clone git repositories.

I was able to use all the commands with practice, but I still need work, and as such will be practicing throughout the rest of the week.

In my opinion, the most important commands to know is help, because it will usually tell you all the other commands that you can perform at that point in time.

The commands are as follows:

pwd - Print working directory, prints the directory you are currently working in.

ls - list, shows all the directories in the working directory

mv - moves a file

cd - change directory, allows you to move from one directory to another

../ - when used as an argument for change directory, will allow you to move back to the next highest directory.

touch - used to create new files

mkdir - used to make new directories

less - displays a file

rmdir - removes a directory

rm - removes a file

help - displays the availible commands or gives you information about a command

#1.4 Create, Fork, and Clone Repositories

How to create a new repo: Login to GitHub, click on the "+" sign in the upper right corner, and select "new repo". Adjust the settings as you wish, and you're done. The repository can be cloned to your computer by accessing the desired destination via the command line or bash, and then using the command "git clone <URL of the repository you wish to clone>. The URL of the repository can be found on the right side of the webpage, above "clone to Desktop".

To Fork a repo, all you have to do is find the repository you wish to fork, and click the "Fork" button on the top right of the page. If you are signed into GitHub, the repo will be forked into your personal account. Users fork repositories so that they can have a copy to play with or modify, as opposed to creating a new one from scratch.

Setting up git and GitHub, I learned that I tend to value typing speed over accuracy. As such, I make simplistic mistakes while typing which can be very annoying when trying to write any line of code, even when it simply involves typing in the proper URL to clone a repo. The rest of setting up git and accessing GitHub was relatively straightforward.
