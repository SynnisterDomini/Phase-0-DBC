It's easy to make a repository on GitHub. All you need to do is log into GitHub and click the plus sign in the upper right hand corner, and select "new repository". If you want to clone it to your computer, open bash and type "git clone [repository URL]". 

Open source means that the original source code of a software program is free and readily available. This is good because it allows for multiple users to look through and modify a piece of code. This could be considered to be a double edged sword, but I like the idea of open source because then I can be in charge of my own personal security. Just like I like the idea of being honest, I also appreciate the idea of full disclosure.

Liscences are important because they state exactly what is to be expected and what is allowed in regards to a specific piece of software. If the software is for sale and intended only to be used as a good, it will say as such in the liscence.

This challenged solidified my knowledge of pull requests. I actually did have an epiphany, and it was when I realized that pull requests were basically GitHub's way of following the add -> commit methadology of git.

I did not find any resources that helped me better understand a topic, unfortunately.
